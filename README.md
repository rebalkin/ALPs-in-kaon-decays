# ALP Kaon Decay Rates Calculator

This repository contains Mathematica code for calculating the decay rates of kaons into axion-like particles (ALPs), including contributions from weak interactions. The primary focus is on three-body decay channels involving ALPs in the final state.

## Features

- Computes decay rates for kaon processes such as:
  - $K^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^0 a$
  - $K_L \to \pi^+ \pi^- a$
  - $K_L \to \pi^0 \pi^0 a$
- Includes both strong and weak interaction contributions.
- Allows for momentum-dependent form factors and phase space integration.

## File

- `3_body_rates_clean.nb`: Main Mathematica notebook containing all symbolic and numerical computations for the decay rates.

## Requirements

- Wolfram Mathematica 12.0 or higher recommended.

## Usage

1. Open `3_body_rates_clean.nb` in Mathematica.
2. Evaluate the notebook step-by-step or run all cells to compute the relevant decay widths.
3. Modify particle masses and coupling constants as needed in the initial parameter section.

## Reference
